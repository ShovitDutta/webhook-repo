### Database üóÑÔ∏è
*   **MongoDB:** A NoSQL database used to store GitHub event payloads.

### Development Tools üßë‚Äçüíª
*   **Prettier:** An opinionated code formatter for maintaining consistent code style.

## Getting Started üöÄ

Follow these instructions to set up and run the GitHub Events Monitor on your local machine.

### Prerequisites ‚úÖ

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

*   **Python 3.x:** Download from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
*   **pip:** Python's package installer (usually comes with Python 3.x).
*   **MongoDB Instance:** A running MongoDB database. You can install it locally or use a cloud service like MongoDB Atlas.

### Installation ‚¨áÔ∏è

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/github-events-monitor.git
    cd github-events-monitor
    ```
    *(Note: Replace `https://github.com/your-username/github-events-monitor.git` with the actual repository URL if available.)*

2.  **Install Python dependencies:**
    First, ensure your `requirements.txt` file contains the necessary packages. If not, you might need to create or correct it.
    ```
    Flask
    pymongo[srv]
    python-dotenv
    Flask-CORS
    colorama
    gunicorn
    ```
    Then, install them:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Environment Configuration ‚öôÔ∏è

Create a file named `.env` in the project root directory and add the following environment variables:

```dotenv
MONGO_URL="mongodb://localhost:27017/"
WEBHOOK_SECRET="your_github_secret_token"
```
*   Replace `"mongodb://localhost:27017/"` with your MongoDB connection string.
*   Replace `"your_github_secret_token"` with a strong, unique secret token. This token will be used to verify GitHub webhook signatures.

### Running the Backend Server üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

You can run the Flask backend in development mode or using Gunicorn for production.

*   **Development Mode:**
    ```bash
    python server.py
    ```
    The server will typically run on `http://localhost:5000`.

*   **Production Mode (using Gunicorn):**
    ```bash
    gunicorn -w 4 -b 0.0.0.0:5000 server:code
    ```
    This command runs the server with 4 worker processes, binding to all network interfaces on port 5000.

### Configure GitHub Webhook üé£

To receive events, you need to configure a webhook in your GitHub repository:

1.  Navigate to your GitHub repository.
2.  Go to **Settings** > **Webhooks**.
3.  Click **Add webhook**.
4.  **Payload URL:** Enter the URL where your server is accessible (e.g., `http://your-server-ip:5000/webhook`). If running locally, you might need a tool like ngrok to expose your local server to the internet.
5.  **Content type:** Select `application/json`.
6.  **Secret:** Enter the `WEBHOOK_SECRET` you defined in your `.env` file.
7.  **Which events would you like to trigger this webhook?**: Select "Let me select individual events." and choose the events you want to monitor (e.g., `Pushes`, `Pull requests`, `Issues`).
8.  Click **Add webhook**.

### Accessing the Frontend üñ•Ô∏è

Once the backend server is running, open your web browser and navigate to:

```
http://localhost:5000
```

You should see the GitHub Events Monitor interface.

### Triggering Events üîî

Perform actions in your configured GitHub repository (e.g., push a commit, open a pull request, create an issue) to trigger webhook events. These events should then appear dynamically on the web interface.

### Cleaning Database (Optional) üóëÔ∏è

To clear all stored GitHub events from the MongoDB database, run the utility script:

```bash
python cleandb.py
```
**Caution:** This will permanently delete all data in the `github_events` database.

## Architecture üèóÔ∏è

The application follows a client-server architecture with a Python Flask backend, a MongoDB database, and a JavaScript-powered frontend. The interaction flow is as follows:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[GitHub Repository] -->|Sends Webhook (POST /webhook)| B(Flask Backend server.py);
    B -->|Verifies Signature & Stores Payload| C[MongoDB Database];
    B -->|Serves webhook.html (GET /)| D[Frontend webhook.html];
    D -->|Fetches Events (GET /events) every 15s| B;
    B -->|Returns 10 Most Recent Events (JSON)| D;
    C -->|Stores Event Payloads| C;
```

1.  **GitHub Webhook:** A GitHub repository sends webhook events (HTTP POST requests to `/webhook`) to the Flask backend whenever a configured event occurs.
2.  **Flask Backend (`server.py`):**
    *   Receives incoming webhooks.
    *   Verifies the webhook signature using the `WEBHOOK_SECRET` for security.
    *   Parses the webhook payload and stores it in the `github_events` database, specifically in the `events` collection.
    *   Serves the main `webhook.html` file when a GET request is made to the root URL (`/`).
    *   Exposes an API endpoint `/events` (GET) that returns the 10 most recent GitHub events from the database as a JSON array.
3.  **MongoDB Database:** Acts as the persistent storage for all received GitHub event payloads.
4.  **Frontend (`templates/webhook.html`):**
    *   A single-page application that runs in the user's browser.
    *   Periodically (every 15 seconds) fetches the latest events by making an AJAX request to the `/events` endpoint on the Flask backend.
    *   Dynamically renders the fetched events on the web page, displaying relevant details such as the author, event type, commit message, and branch names.
    *   Provides interactive elements, allowing users to click on an event to open its corresponding URL on GitHub.
    *   Displays a connection status indicator to inform the user about the frontend's ability to communicate with the backend.
5.  **`cleandb.py`:** A standalone Python utility script that connects to the MongoDB database and drops the entire `github_events` database, effectively clearing all stored event data.

## Usage üí°

Once the server is running and the GitHub webhook is configured, simply navigate to `http://localhost:5000` in your browser. The frontend will automatically fetch and display new events as they are triggered in your GitHub repository.

*   **View Events:** Events will appear in a list, showing details like the event type, author, and a brief description. üëÄ
*   **Open on GitHub:** Click on any event entry to open the corresponding page on GitHub in a new tab, providing more context. üîó
*   **Monitor Connection:** Observe the connection status indicator on the page to ensure the frontend is successfully communicating with the backend. üü¢
